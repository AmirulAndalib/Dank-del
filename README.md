Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Sayan, a 22-year-old with a passion for computers and art, currently based in Kolkata, India.

I'm actively exploring and learning various programming languages, including Python, C#, and Go. Check out my pinned repositories to get a glimpse of my current projects. I enjoy creating software for fun challenges and to contribute value to others.
